        description: `“I recently did my daughter’s 3rd birthday at home, I reached out to Pop & Palm and they did such a wonderful set up. It was beautiful and very clean.
I appreciate the time and effort it took for them to set it up and the real test was the balloons which didn’t pop at all despite the humidity being quite awful that particular day.
I appreciate the small details taken into consideration and the honesty and transparency.
The owners could have sold many services but they were honest about what should be done etc which I respected immensely.
I would recommend them again and have some plans for some future events.”`,

I am so happy with how everything turned out and highly recommend them to anyone who doesn't enjoy planning and DIYing things or simply just doesn't have the time to do it and would rather leave it to the professionals. It truly allowed for our family to enjoy our baby's birthday and be present.”`,
